Physical Data Structures -> Arrays and Linked List

Logical Data Structures -> Linear-> Stacks, Queues
                        -> non-linear -> Trees , Graphs
                        -> Tabular -> Hash Memory

Each And Every Logical Data Structures are implemented using Physical Data Structures.

ADT: Abstract Data Type
Data Type : 1. Representation of Data , 2. Operation on Data.
